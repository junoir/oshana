                  <p>
                    This morning we will be travelling south to the world-renowned Etosha National Park. This unique, 22’270km²large area consists of wide-open plains and dense bush savannah that surround a parched salt desert known as the Etosha Pan. This desolate saline depression shimmers with terrestrial heat during the hotter parts of the day, and is surrounded by a number of waterholes that ensure the survival of 114 different game, as well as 340 different bird species. Wait in anticipation at a selection of waterholes that supp ort a rich diversity of mammals and birds. Some of these include rare and endangered species such as black-faced Impala, Roan, Black Rhino as well as the Elusive Eland, the largest antelope on earth. Each waterhole visited holds a surprise as no game drive is ever the same and we keep our eyes permanently peeled to try and glimpse the trunk of the elephant, the yellow eyes of the lion or the chequered face of the leopard behind the next bush. Overnight: Namutoni Camp – 1st night Okaukeujo Camp – 2nd night.                </p>

                    This morning we will be travelling through a network of dry river beds an interspersed acacia plains into the rugged and unspoilt Kaokoland, a land marked by undulating hills and open plains inhabited by the Ovahimba. Our lodge is situated on a hill with a spectacular 36odegree view over the Kaokoland.
                    Opuwo is the gateway to Namibia's Kaokoveld region. This remote area, south of the Kunene river, is home to the Himba; people who have kept their ethnic individuality and culture, whilst surviving in the seclusion of Kaokoland.
                    The hotel has a dining room, bar, lounge, wine cellar, curio shop, patio and swimming pool. Breakfast, lunch and dinner are normally served buffet style, but guests are welcome to order from the 'a la carte' menu if they prefer. Snacks can be ordered throughout the day.

Swakopmund coastal town is better known as Namibia’s playground, this idyllic town is wedged between the sweltering Namib Desert and cold Atlantic Ocean. This desert town is a rhapsody of adventure, fun, exploration and relaxation.

Our lodge is situated just 20 km from the famous Fish River Canyon amidst huge granite boulders. In the evening we have the opportunity to walk onto a nearby hill with an experienced guide, from where we have a beautiful view to witness the sunset.

                  <h5>Day 11, 12, 13 Etosha National Park</h5>
                  <p>
                    This morning we will be travelling south to the world-renowned Etosha National Park. This unique, 22’270km²large area consists of wide-open plains and dense bush savannah that surround a parched salt desert known as the Etosha Pan. This desolate saline depression shimmers with terrestrial heat during the hotter parts of the day, and is surrounded by a number of waterholes that ensure the survival of 114 different game, as well as 340 different bird species. Wait in anticipation at a selection of waterholes that supp ort a rich diversity of mammals and birds. Some of these include rare and endangered species such as black-faced Impala, Roan, Black Rhino as well as the Elusive Eland, the largest antelope on earth. Each waterhole visited holds a surprise as no game drive is ever the same and we keep our eyes permanently peeled to try and glimpse the trunk of the elephant, the yellow eyes of the lion or the chequered face of the leopard behind the next bush. Overnight: Okaukuejo Camp – 1st night Halali Camp – 2nd night Namutoni Camp – 3rd night.

                    The Waterberg Plateau is a particularly prominent location, elevating high above the plains of the Kalahari of Eastern Namibia. Waterberg Park and some 405 km² of surrounding land were declared a Nature Reserve in 1972. The plateau is largely inaccessible so in the early 1970s several of Namibia's endangered species were soon translocated there to protect them from predators and poaching to extinction. The programme was very successful and Waterberg now supplies other Namibian parks with rare animals. In 1989, black rhinoceros was reintroduced to the area from Damaraland. Overnight: Waterberg Camp.

As you head to the Etosha National Park, your time will be devoted purely to the abundant wildlife.This unique, 22’270km²large area consists of wideopen plains and dense bush savannah that surround a parched salt desert known as the Etosha Pan. This desolate saline depression shimmers with terrestrial heat during the hotter parts of the day, and is surrounded by a number of waterholes that ensure the survival of 114 different game, as well as 340 different bird species. Wait in anticipation at a selection of waterholes that support a rich diversity of mammals and birds. Some of these include rare and endangered species such as black-faced Impala, Roan, Black Rhino as well as the Elusive Eland, the largest antelope on earth. Each waterhole visited holds a surprise as no game drive is ever the same and we keep our eyes permanently peeled to try and glimpse the trunk of the elephant, the yellow eyes of the lion or the chequered face of the leopard behind the next bush.

The plateau is largely inaccessible so in the early 1970s several of Namibia's endangered species were soon translocated there to protect them from predators and poaching to extinction. he programme was very successful and Waterberg now supplies other Namibian parks with rare animals. In 1989, black rhinoceros was reintroduced to the area from Damaraland. Overnight: Waterberg Camp.

                  <p>
                    This morning we will be travelling north to the world-renowned Etosha National Park. This unique, 22’270km²large area consists of wide-open plains and dense bush savannah that surround a parched salt desert known as the Etosha Pan. This desolate saline depression shimmers with terrestrial heat during the hotter parts of the day, and is surrounded by a number of waterholes that ensure the survival of 114 different game, as well as 340 different bird species. Wait in anticipation at a selection of waterholes that supp ort a rich diversity of mammals and birds. Some of these include rare and endangered species such as black-faced Impala, Roan, Black Rhino as well as the Elusive Eland, the largest antelope on earth. Each waterhole visited holds a surprise as no game drive is ever the same and we keep our eyes permanently peeled to try and glimpse the trunk of the elephant, the yellow eyes of the lion or the chequered face of the leopard behind the next bush.

                  <p>
                    Departing Windhoek / Swakopmund, we travel into the Namib Desert with its monumental dunes and everchanging colours. This is the oldest desert on Earth; nevertheless it supports a vast diversity of adapted fauna and flora that accentuate this pristine environment even further. Optional activities at our lodge consist of scenic nature drives and marvellous walking trails. Namib Desert - the oldest desert on earth, formed by the effect of the cold Benguela Current. Due to early morning fog, this arid desert becomes a life supporting structure for all its living organisms. You will find yourself in the vicinity of Sossusvlei, an area marked by some of the highest dunes on earth. Sossusvlei’s monumentally high dunes are a sought after topic for photographers. With their warm tints ranging from pale apricot to brick orange and deep red, they contrast vividly wit the large white clay pans at their basis. Sossusvlei - meaning "the gathering place of the water" - is a striking white pan surrounded by Camelthorn trees and the towering orange dunes of the Namib. Here the waters of the Tsauchab River are blocked from reaching the ocean by a formidable wall of dunes, stretching sixty kilometres to the sea. Occasionally the floodwaters of the river reach Sossusvlei and gather to form a small, shallow lake in the middle of the dunes. Although difficult climbing, the view from the top of one of the highest dunes in the world is well worth the effort, besides which, it's great fun sliding, jumping, rolling or "swimming" back down the dunes! Beware of car keys and other valuables falling out of your pockets! Bronze: Soft Adventure Camp (D) Silver: Namib Naukluft Lodge (D).

                    The best time to experience the Sossusvlei area is at sunrise when the new light paints the dunes and desert plains into a variety of deep reds, apricot and purple – a photographers dream come true! We travel into the heart of the Namib Desert with the highest sand dunes on earth at Sossusvlei. Experience the majestic yet tranquil Sossusvlei or the surreal Dead Vlei on foot. We enjoy a picnic lunch under the Camelthorn trees, before traveling back to our lodge via the gaping Sesriem Canyon. In the afternoon join a nature drive to the magnificent Marble Mountain, where you can enjoy a sundowner drink (drinks not included in rate).
